				<h3>KEY FACTS</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4 class="loc">Location</h4>
						<p>The Peruvian Achuar live on both sides of the Peru-Ecuador border along the headwaters of the Pastaza, Morona and Corrientes rivers basins.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4 class="loc">Land Size</h4>
						<p>2.2 million acres (in Peru), 0.9 million hectares.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4 class="pop">Population</h4>
						<p>The Peruvian Achuar are a community of only 12,200 individuals living in 44 distinct smaller communities and call an area of nearly 2.2 million acres of rainforest their home.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4 class="thr">Threat</h4>
						<p>Dire threats from oil companies exploring and drilling for oil deeper in this region impacting the community’s way of life and the rainforest’s biodiversity including countless species of fauna and flora.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4 class="thr">Threat</h4>
						<p>Due to their remote location, this indigenous community also does not have adequate access to essential services like education and developed healthcare.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4 class="pro">Project Plan</h4>
						<p>Create a socio-economic business model that would value Achuar culture and traditional livelihood through the sustainable use of natural resources.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4 class="pro">Curious Fact</h4>
						<p>The Achuar territory encompasses tributaries to the Amazon river whose headwaters are the lowland Amazon rainforest. This is why oil exploration activities in some parts of the Achuar land can cause disseminating devastation to vast areas of the rainforest.</p>

			<p>The Achuar, an indigenous rainforest community who live deep in the Amazon, maintain a rich

culture, including an intrinsic knowledge to create traditional medicines and products that are

naturally derived from the forest. But the community lacks the necessary infrastructure and the

skills to market their products and services outside of their territory or create a reliable source of

sustainable income.
</p>

			<div class="quote common_width">
				<p>Rainforest Partnership’s collaboration with the Achuar community has been in the works for the last two years when the Achuar leaders had approached us to work with them and develop sustainable income sources for their community members. The Achuar as a people adopted a life plan over 20 years ago and this still serve as their guiding principles. Empowering the community economically, as desired by the Achuar leadership and by Rainforest Partnership, will help them maintain their strong voice in opposing the intrusion of powerful outside interests disrupting their forest and way of life, while providing the community with the tools to take advantage of the abundant natural wealth that can be derived from keeping the rainforests standing.

				<h3>Project Objectives</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Developing the Traditional Medical Center – At their traditional medical center, the Achuar community use a specific kind of distillation process to distill medicinal plants found in the rainforest and clay to treat and cure a variety of sickness. Support includes providing training and logistical guidance for those working at the centre; further developing and improving the infrastructure of the building; establishing better communications systems with nearby communities; and constructing a separate building with adequate rooms to hold and shelter patients traveling from distant places (it takes 4 days walk from the far-most community).</li>
					<li>Construction of a common community well at the site of the Achuar people’s federation building in San Lorenzo, which is the closest town on the river downstream to their territory with more services for the distinct communities to access. The well will thus support all the Achuar people in a central location and has been strongly requested by the leaders since there is no clean water source there.</li>
					<li>Cultural and environmental education – Providing education to the younger generation in as many of the 44 communities as possible for them to understand the importance of the very unique but fast eroding Achuar culture and way of life and the critical need for balance between human development and environmental well-being. This has also been a strong request from the Achuar leaders and upon visiting the Achuar territory, Rainforest Partnership agrees why this is essential for their long-term sustainability.</li>
					<li>Site Visits and Field Co-ordination – Funding of community selected and skilled  members who will serve as project coordinators in the Achuar territory as well as other Rainforest Partnership project coordinators who will provide support and project oversight. The remoteness of the community and the large area in which they are all spread out, makes it very expensive in terms of time and funds to visit the community. Accessing the community is only possible by small plane or by a boat that takes 2-3 days.</li>
